# server-one

store for phoenix files.

How to upload on the main page of the repo (server) click add file. There you can upload files up to 25mb. Click commit. It will ask you to commit to the main branch choose this ONLY. DO NOT MAKE A NEW BRANCH, this is developer tool for creating alt-versions and is best left to WEB STAFF ONLY. Please contact Newave to create folders. Files cannot be efficently moved so make sure to upload it in the correct folder. 

# NOTE

This is a public server please ONLY SHARE THE SERVER LINK PAGE: "". DO NOT SHARE THIS PAGE OUTSIDE OF PHOENIX STAFF. ***THIS IS FOR MANAGEMENT ONLY!!!*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

## Best practices 

please zip folders to make them easiar to download. If the zip file is too big please upload the file in several seperate zip files. Folders are to give names to groups such as: Music samples, artwork, full songs. Please do not use folders when none are required.

Please ty to upload only finished work and not WIP's as this creates a mess that is hard to clean up. Thank you!
New versions of files should be labeled as per format: newfile1.ext => newfile2.ext (change the file name bu numbers to prevent the server from becoming confused.

# Create a folder (Use at your own risk)
