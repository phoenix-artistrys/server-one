# !!!IMPORTANT!!!

**!!!PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS COMPLETELY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!!!**

This is a public server please ONLY SHARE THE SERVER LINK PAGE: "". DO NOT SHARE THIS PAGE OUTSIDE OF PHOENIX STAFF. ***THIS IS FOR MANAGEMENT ONLY!!!*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
Changes only take place once you have clicked the green "Commit changes..."

DO NOT AT ANY TIME USE THE TERMINAL TO MAKE CHANGES. ALWAYS USE THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI).

## Best practices 

***Please zip folders to make them easiar to download***. ***If the zip file is too big please upload the file in several seperate zip files***. Folders are to give names to groups such as: Music samples, artwork, full songs. ***Please do not use folders when none are required***.

Please ty to upload only finished work and not WIP's as this creates a mess that is hard to clean up. Thank you!
New versions of files should be labeled as per format: newfile1.ext => newfile2.ext (change the file name bu numbers to prevent the server from becoming confused.
