## Best practices 

***Please zip folders to make them easiar to download***. ***If the zip file is too big please upload the file in several seperate zip files***. Folders are to give names to groups such as: Music samples, artwork, full songs. ***Please do not use folders when none are required***.

**Please ty to upload only finished work and not WIP's as this creates a mess that is hard to clean up. Thank you!**
**New versions of files should be labeled as per format: newfile1.ext => newfile2.ext (change the file name bu numbers to prevent the server from becoming confused).**

## Create a download link

Create an https download link by typing out a link like this:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phoenix-artistys/server-one/main/foldername/filename.extention

**e.g: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phoenix-artistys/server-one/main/music/song.wav**

Each slash represents a folder. The name of the folder/files comes after.

# Create a folder (Use at your own risk)
